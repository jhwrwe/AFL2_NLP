    "# 1. Background Problem (20%)\n",
    "Language modeling is a fundamental task in Natural Language Processing (NLP), used in various applications like predictive typing, text generation, and spelling correction. For this project, I chose the Sci-Fi Stories Text Corpus available on Kaggle. Sci-Fi literature is linguistically rich and imaginative, often pushing boundaries of vocabulary and structure. Modeling such text is both challenging and rewarding, and it provides an exciting opportunity to explore how well statistical language models and autocorrect systems can handle complex and creative writing. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models can generalize to a wide variety of tasks, including creative text generation and spelling correction, even in few-shot settings. Studies have also shown that while language models are capable of producing creative writing, they face unique challenges in maintaining coherence and handling the imaginative language found in genres like science fiction. Furthermore, advances in spelling correction techniques have highlighted the importance of robust language modeling for correcting errors in creative and domain-specific texts\n",

    "# 6. Conclusion & Future Work (5%)\n",
    "The Sci-Fi Writing Assistant exhibits a high level of competency in both next-word prediction and autocorrect functionalities. Through quantitative evaluation using Top‑k accuracy and qualitative analysis of generated text, the system has shown to provide meaningful, context-aware suggestions that align well with science fiction genre expectations. The assistant demonstrates its potential as a practical writing aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Test Outputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: hello → Suggestions: hellos, hellofa, hellop, helloing, hellovalot | Predictions: he, to, hello, mr, there\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: hows your day → Suggestions: days, day's, daystart, dayfolk | Predictions: with, but, and, off, paranoia\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: sitting in → Predictions: the, a, his, front, an\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: sat at → Suggestions: atop, attentively | Predictions: the, a, his, her, their\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: sleep → Suggestions: sleeping, sleepy, sleeps, sleepily, sleeper | Predictions: and, he, in, the, i\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: need → Suggestions: needed, needs, needle, needles, needn't | Predictions: to, a, for, it, of\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: sanked → Did you mean: yanked, banked, snaked? | Predictions: the, and, of, to, a\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: she's gorg → Suggestions: gorge, gorgon, gorgeous, gorgons, gorges | Predictions: w\n",
    "\n",
    "-Input: fine as → Suggestions: astounding, ash, assassin, astronomical, aside | Predictions: long, far, the, you, a\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples illustrate the model's adaptability to informal input, correction of typographical errors, and ability to maintain coherent narrative flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, based on the results, we conclude that the model is sufficiently robust for use as a lightweight genre-specific writing assistant. It offers meaningful suggestions and corrections that can enhance creativity and fluency in science fiction writing tasks. The architecture remains interpretable and efficient, making it well-suited for early-stage product prototypes or academic exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Future works\n",
    "To further refine the Sci-Fi Writing Assistant, the following enhancements are proposed:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Smoothing Techniques: Apply advanced smoothing (e.g., Kneser-Ney) to better handle unseen n-grams.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Transformer Integration: Investigate the use of transformer-based models (e.g., BERT, GPT) for improved semantic predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Corpus Expansion: Train on larger and more diverse sci-fi literature to improve lexical richness.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Contextual Grammar Assistance: Include grammar correction alongside autocorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "-NER for Sci-Fi Terms: Implement named entity recognition to improve handling of fictional names and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Human Evaluation: Incorporate user feedback and human evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU, Perplexity) to better assess language quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These directions will help elevate the tool from a statistical assistant to a more intelligent, context-aware writing partner."
